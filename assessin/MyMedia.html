   <!-- ***
        Whenever you do any style stuff, the rules are always specified in the same format:

        property-name: value;

        So, if you want to specify a background colour, you would write:

        background-color: #f79d77;

        You don't need value=""

        Putting this in as the value for the style attribute would give you:

        <body style="background-color: #f79d77">

        You can add multiple rules, just separate them out with ; in between each. If you want to change the font-family on your site
        for example, the body is a great place to do this as it'll filter down to everything else.

        <body style="background-color: #f79d77; font-family: sans-serif">

        This is all specifying style using the style attribute. It would be better to include your style rules either 
        at the top of the page, or even better, in a separate style sheet. The formatting of the rules is still the same. 
        Have a look at the video on Blackboard about selecting elements to style with CSS.

         You've got various uses of id and class here. You don't need them. The id on the <nav> element is to be able to do 
         something with it with JavaScript. Without also including that JavaScript it's redundance.
                                                
         Similarly, the class names here were for adding some CSS rules to these things, but that's not happening here either.
                                                
         The 'fas' and 'fa-bars' class names relate to a third-party plugin called font awesome that gives you access to 
         lots of icons. It's really great, and fairly easy to use, but to do so you need to include their JavaScripts file.
          
         This menu could have been written as:
         <nav>
            <a href="Home.html">Home</a>
            <a href="MyMedia.html">My Media</a>
          </nav>                             
          
          With some styling applied to make those <a> elements look like menu buttons or some such, instead of normal text links.

     Headings aren't intended to increment down the page, h1 to h6. The number denotes their relative importance, not their position.
                                       
     Your main heading (My Media) is a h1. All these other headings are subheadings of that - all at the same level - so they should 
     all be h2.
