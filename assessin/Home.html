         They're created like this, although without the ***, I just put that in to

         Ah, font awesome. What you've tried to do here is use a third party font library
         that provides loads of icons. You've copied the HTML, but not the extra bit 
         of script that will draw the required icon in the <i> element.

       If you do on-page style like this, it should go in the <head> section. 
       Anything that provides information about the page goes in the <head>.
       Anything that gets displayed on the page goes in the <body>.

       You've written the CSS correctly though, this is good :)

<h1> Home </h1>
<p> Hi! Welcome to my website! Here you will find a bunch of
  random stuff mashed together to try to complete this website. </p>
<! About Me>
  <h2> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Carmen, I am based in Northamptonshire but currently studying Media Production at DMU in Leicester.
  Born in 2000, my interests over the past 20 years have flourished into many different strands such as: </p>
   <ul>
     <li> Music </li>
     <li> Astrology </li>
     <li> Gaming </li>
     </ul>
<p2> When I was younger I was deeply into music but when I turned 15, my hobbies developed into learning media production.
  But why? After having multiple set-backs with preforming, I found that creating a story within film is also a great
  way to be myself without having to worry about anything. Fast forward to now, I'm in Uni trying to create a website
  from scratch. Never thought I would end up doing this. If your new to this and reading this, warning, its complicated...
  The end goal is for me to become a teacher within Media, whether it be university level or college. I would
love the opportunity to shape young peoples minds and enable them to share their own stories just like I have.

That kinda sounds cringy did'nt it... </p2>
